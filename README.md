# StarPlayrX
Sirius XM streaming radio for iOS, macOS and iPadOS. StarPlayrX is accessible and this is one of its strong suits.

X stands for ten. StarPlayr was originally targeted for iOS back in 2009. The app encountered a good bit of misfortune and NiceMac was disbanned. A decade later its original creator and founder of NiceMac, Todd Bruss created StarPlayrX and released it to the iOS app store. 

The Mac Catalyst version of StarPlayrX can be compiled by individuals. There will be macOS releases, but there is not timeline in this.

StarPlayrX is open source along with its two libraries StarPlayrRadioKit and Swifter-Lite, so who is interested and have some experience with Swift can create their own StarPlayr.

"Don't be a Slacker, be a Star Player."

p.s.

CameoKit and Perfect4 is now deprecated. It has been replaced with StarPlayrRadioKit and Swifter-Lite (fork from Swifter). All three repos are located on my Github's main page.
